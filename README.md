The main aim of this project is to design an automated solution for collecting data from recruit
ment sites and classifying it efficiently using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing
 (NLP) techniques. This application has been developed entirely in Java, and automatically pro
cesses and classifies advertisements according to specific criteria, offering a fast and relevant
 solution for job seekers.
 The project involved several stages, such as expression of need, functional analysis, UML de
sign, and identification of test cases. Particular attention was paid to code quality to guarantee
 the robustness and reliability of the application developed in Java.
 Through this project, we were able to deepen our knowledge of Java programming, as well
 as Machine Learning and NLP, while providing a practical solution for the automated processing
 of online job advertisements
